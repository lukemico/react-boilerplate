# README React Boilerplate

A template for building a React application which includes:

- working with webpack and babel to transform, code-split, and bundle code.
- create npm scripts to execute commands and work with git and GitHub to track changes and share our code in public.
- build quality into our project with Jest for unit testing and ESLint for static analysis.
- configure Prettier for formatting and then enforce all these quality checks before commit with git hooks.
- incorporate some accessibility checks and enforce some best practices in React with react-axe, React's StrictMode and a default ErrorBoundary component.
